User Messages will allow the users registered on your blog to have a private Inbox on your site. 

== Description ==

WordPress does not allow your users to communicate with each other. Some forum plugins can add this functionnality but are quite heavy, do other things and updates might not be focussed on improving the messaging features. This is why User Messages is born: a plugin to facilitate communication between your users.

All the instructions for installation, the support forums, etc. can be found on the [plugin home page](http://user-messages.vincentprat.info).

*IMPORTANT: LICENSE CHANGE*

Since version 2.0.0, the plugin has become a commercial plugin. It can be ordered (for cheap) on the [plugin home page](http://user-messages.vincentprat.info). 

Version 1.2.x will remain available for download for free on the WordPress plugin repository. No further development will be made on this version. 

*CHANGES*

Version 2.0.0: the user interface is now fully integrated to your blog, keep a copy of sent messages, permalinks, quotas are more coherent, a few bug fixes.
