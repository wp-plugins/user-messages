User Messages will allow the users registered on your blog to have a private Inbox on your site. 

== Description ==

WordPress does not allow your users to communicate with each other. Some forum plugins can add this functionnality but are quite heavy, do other things and updates might not be focussed on improving the messaging features. This is why User Messages is born: a plugin to facilitate communication between your users.

All the instructions for installation, the support forums, a FAQ, etc. can be found on the [plugin home page](http://user-messages.vincentprat.info).

This plugin is available under the GPL license, which means that it's free. If you use it for a commercial web site, if you appreciate my efforts or if you want to encourage me to develop and maintain it, please consider making a donation using Paypal, a secured payment solution. You just need to click the donate button on the [plugin home page](http://user-messages.vincentprat.info) and follow the instructions.
